---------------------------------------------------------------------
A)         HOW TO UPGRADE FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Uncompress the WPSFWxxx.ZIP file to a 720K or 1.44MB diskette
   (You'll need PKUNZIP version 2.04e or later to uncompress this
    file.  You may obtain the latest PKUNZIP version from the
    PCTOOLS disk).
   If installing from hard disk, create a directory and copy
   all the files to it.

2. Restore the original Windows shell, PROGMAN.EXE by placing the
   following line in the SYSTEM.INI file:

   shell=progman.exe

   Comment out any other "shell=" lines by placing a ';' (semi-colon)
   in front of the line.

3. Backup your original WPSHELL.INI file in the \WINDOWS directory.
   This is done just as a precaution so that you can always restore
   your original desktop if you miss a step.  You can name the backup
   file anything you want (i.e. WPSHELL.BAK or WPSBAK.INI).

4. Boot Windows 3.1x, and run "A:\SETUP.EXE" from the diskette (or hard
   drive).

5. Press the "Upgrade" pushbutton in the main setup dialog.

6. Enter destination directory where current release is stored.

7. Select which language resources you want to install in your system.
   Press ENTER if you just want the default.  (Remeber that for you
   to use the different language resources, you need to change the
   "sLanguage" key in the "Intl" section of the WIN.INI file.  Read
   the README.1ST file for more information).

8. After the installation has successfully finished, restart
   Windows so that the new shell will take effect.



---------------------------------------------------------------------
B)                  HOW TO DO A NEW INSTALL
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Uncompress the WPSFWxxx.ZIP file to a 720K or 1.44MB diskette
   (You'll need PKUNZIP version 2.04e or later to uncompress this
    file.  You may obtain the latest PKUNZIP version from the
    PCTOOLS disk).
   If installing from hard disk, create a directory and copy
   all the files to it.

2. While in Windows 3.1x, run "A:\SETUP.EXE" from the diskette (or
   hard drive).

3. Press the "New" pushbutton in the main setup dialog.

4. Choose Express install or Custom install and a destination
   directory.  The installation program backs up any changes
   to Windows *.INI files and does not modify your current
   PROGMAN desktop *.GRP files.

5. Select which language resources you want to install in your system.
   Press ENTER if you just want the default.  (Remeber that for you
   to use the different language resources, you need to change the
   "sLanguage" key in the "Intl" section of the WIN.INI file.  Read
   the README.1ST file for more information).

6. Restart Windows 3.1x so that the new shell will take effect.



--------------------------------------------------------------------
C)  "WPSHELL.INI MISSING OR CORRUPTED" MESSAGE AFTER INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

   If you get the error message "WPSHELL.INI missing or corrupted"
when re-starting Windows after the WPSFWIN installation has completed,
then do the following:

1. Edit the SYSTEM.INI file in your Windows directory and restore
   "shell=progman.exe" line by removing the ";" (semi-colon) at the
   beginning of the line.  Place a ";" (semi-colon) at the beginning
   of the "shell=<path>\wpshell.exe" line.

2. Start Windows and run CONVINI.EXE from the "File"->"Run" menu item
   in Program Manager.  CONVINI.EXE is stored in your WPSFWIN destination
   directory (by default C:\WPSHELL).

3. Press the "Migrate" pushbutton.

4. After CONVINI.EXE has completed successfully, exit program, and
   exit Windows.

5. Undo the changes made in step (1), and restart Windows again.  This
   time WPSFWIN should come up successfully and with no error messages.

   If you still get the error message, or CONVINI.EXE did not complete
successfully, then you might have to re-install WPSFWIN as a "New"
install to create a new desktop file (and loose all current changes).



--------------------------------------------------------------------
D)        NO DRIVES OBJECTS AND TEMPLATES IN MY DESKTOP
--------------------------------------------------------------------

   If you are upgrading from any version below 1.3, then you might
need to run PMTOWP.EXE manually after the installation has completed
in order to get the "Drives" objects and templates.

   If when you restart Windows w/WPSFWIN you do not see a "Drives"
folder inside the "Windows System" folder, then you need to follow
these steps (unless you do not want the drives objects):

1. Either from Program Manager or WPSFWIN, run PMTOWP.EXE (stored
   in the WPSFWIN destination directory).

2. Select the "Selected Group" radio button.  Select any group folder
   you want (it does not really matter which).
   Check on the "System Folder" and "Templates Folder" checkboxes.

3. Press the "Migrate" pushbutton.  IMPORTANT: Answer "No" when asked
   if want to overwrite current WPSHELL.INI file.  Then, press the "Done"
   pushbutton when the migration has complted.

4. Exit Windows (without saving the desktop! very important!!), then
   restart Windows again.

5. Now, PMTOWP has create a duplicate "Program Manager Folder", "Windows
   System" folder, and "Templates" folder.  If you did not move these
   folders from their original positions, PMTOWP will place them exactly
   right on top of each other.  Therefore, to remove the unwanted
   folders, drag & drop the above mentioned folders from their current
   locations and you'll see another folder underneath them.
   For the "Program Manager Folder", delete the new one.  For the
   "Windows System" folder, delete the old one.  For the "Templates"
   folder, delete the old one.

6. Now you can re-arrange the folders to your content and save the
   desktop by selecting right mouse button on the desktop and clicking
   on "Save desktop".  You are now done.



--------------------------------------------------------------------
E)            AFTER INSTALLATION HAS COMPLETED...
--------------------------------------------------------------------

   Read the README.1ST file copied into the destination directory.
You can also erase the WPSFWxxx.ZIP file since it is no longer needed.

   Also, read LICENSE.TXT file for details on IBM EWS license
agreement.

   To ask questions, report problems, or send comments read the
README.1ST file.
